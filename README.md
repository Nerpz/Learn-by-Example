# Learn-by-Example
Abstract: Learn to code entirely by example. Let me know if you think of any improvements.

You'll need a text editor to write hyper text markup language, cascading style sheets, and JavaScript in. 
  - HTML, CSS, and JS

I predominately use Microsoft's Visual Studio code. There's so many options though. If you don't know one to use, just use Microsoft VScode until you know what it is you desire out of a text editor.

The rest of this course(maybe), will be completed by reading examples. There is a index.html file in each example folder. At the top of index.html you'll find the assignment specifics. 

1.  To speed things up, you should have the "Live Server" extension downloaded for VScode. 
2.  In your file system, navigate into the example folder that includes index.html.
3. Click once, then right click the folder that contains the example you'd like, and select, "open with code. "
4. Open index.html inside VScode, right click anywhere within the document, and select open with live server.
5. Now, in another empty folder, right click and select open with code. 
6. Now, create a index.html file to create the home page of your assignment.
If you think of another project you'd like to do besides the assignment, just do it. If there's something you want to build, build it. The internet contains all the information you need to create amazing projects. If I can help point you in the right direction, I will, just ask.   I'd love to see or even include your completed assignments in these examples. 

Absolute beginners, please start at the beginning and go in order. 
If you've kinda tinkered with html css or js, or you're coming from another language, just start at whichever example looks the most interesting. 


Figure it out! Does this break it? Does this work? Only one way to find out. Try it.

If you find this repo useful, please let me know. I'll continute to add more examples.
