   <p>And it's Bill Gates. Apparently, his car broke down and he needs to use your phone. After using your phone he sees your laptop on the table. Upon reading the text based adventure you just created, he offers you a job. Says it's the best text based adventure he's ever read. You start working at microsoft the next week and by the time your 40 you're in a million dollar house and have everything you've ever wanted. Programming is awesome.</p>
